        <ol>
            <li>Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components,
                connections to the outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including operational and
                security components in the design.</li>
            <li>Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners,
                vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening, anti-virus tools, patch
                management, auditing and assessment.</li>
            <li>Construct, implement and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or other tasks such as
                installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management, updates, auditing,
                analysis and assessment.</li>
            <li>Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an
                incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy,
                assessments or troubleshooting procedures.</li>
            <li>Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements
                that pertain to information security.</li>
            <li>Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security-based threats, risks, malicious activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques or unconventional tactics to prevent loss of sensitive information and data confidentiality, integrity and availability.</li>
